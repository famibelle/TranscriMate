AI Training for Tech

      The training is tailored for participants with a technical background and includes practical sessions, allowing them to understand and experiment with the concepts in a hands-on manner. Knowledge of Python is necessary. The content and the duration of the course can be adapted to fit your needs, especially for the hands-on labs.

AI for Tech
1. From Data Science to AI
Overview of the journey from traditional data analysis to advanced AI applications.
o IA-ML-DL-GenAI:
Explore the spectrum of AI, starting with Artificial Intelligence (IA), moving to Machine Learning (ML), and then progressing to Deep Learning (DL). Discuss how Generative AI (GenAI) fits into this landscape and its transformative potential.
o How to train a model:
A step-by-step breakdown of model training, including data preprocessing, feature selection, model selection, training process, and evaluation metrics. Discuss practical examples and tools like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
o Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning:
Introduce different learning paradigms:
Supervised Learning: Labeled data and prediction tasks.
Unsupervised Learning: Clustering and discovering hidden patterns.
Reinforcement Learning: Decision-making through feedback loops, with a focus on applications in robotics, gaming, and autonomous systems.

2. Special Topic on Natural Language Processing (NLP)
The AI domain focused on interactions between computers and humans through natural language.
o Tokenization and Embeddings:
Overview of tokenization techniques and word embeddings such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and BERT.
o Text Classification and Sentiment Analysis:
Practical example of building an NLP model for text classification or sentiment analysis using Transformers.




3. MLOps: Deploying and Monitoring AI Models
Managing AI workflows from development to production.
o Model Deployment:
Overview of deployment pipelines using Docker, Kubernetes, and API endpoints.
o Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) in AI:
Introduce how CI/CD practices are applied in AI workflows for deploying and updating models efficiently.

4. A Deep Dive into GenAI
Exploring the architecture and potential of Generative AI models.
o Encoder-Decoder:
Discuss this foundational architecture for translation and summarization tasks. Explain how the encoder compresses input information, and the decoder reconstructs or generates the output.
o Transformers:
A critical focus on how transformers revolutionized AI by overcoming the limitations of traditional sequence models. Discuss key concepts like self-attention and scalability, as well as practical implementations like BERT, GPT, and LLMs.
o Use Cases:
Present a wide range of use cases, from text generation, chatbots, and code completion to creative applications like art generation and music composition.

5. Fine tuning
Definition and advanced concepts in implementing open-source models trained with new data.
o Definition:
Understand the interest of fine tuning instead of training, using adapters like Lora and QLora. Learn key concepts such as transfer learning, layer freezing, domain adaptation. 
o Implementation & Use Cases:
Discuss its applications in nowadays AI development and deployment. Explore how to integrate this with hands-on labs.

6. Ethics and Responsibility
A critical aspect of AI development ensuring fairness, transparency, and safety.
o Bias, Transparency, and Data Protection:
Explore challenges of bias in AI models and the need for transparency in model decisions. Discuss data protection measures and how they align with responsible AI practices.
o Regulation (GDPR, AI Act):
Introduce major AI regulations, such as GDPR and the upcoming AI Act in the EU. Focus on compliance, ethical data collection, and usage, and how these regulations shape the development and deployment of AI systems.
